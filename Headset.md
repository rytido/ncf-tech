# Notes on headsets

## Models

### E6OW6C1SR

In 2015 we got the Countryman E6OW6C1SR, a single ear mic.

E6-O-W6-C-1-SR

- E6 is the mic. There’s also E6i or E6x version which are more flexible, but the idea is that we keep that on a single pastor and use other mics for guest preachers. So we don’t need flexibility.
- O means omnidirectional. They make a directional version, but at the time, everyone online was like “Positioning a directional mic sucks”. If we’re constantly struggling with feedback from the room speakers, maybe we need to give up and get a directional mic. I wish there were a way to try it out. But you can’t return mics.
- W6 is the gain sensitivity (W5 is normal talking gain, W6 is higher dynamic range (sometimes shouting/singing), W7 is like an opera singer).
- C means cocoa color, (they also make light beige, tan, or black)
- 1 is 1mm cable thickness,
- SR means sennheiser connection (Shure is an alternative)

Also at some point the boom on the original headset broke (out of warranty) so we just bought a second one. I still have the original in my basement. Theoretically we could tape it together or something and it’d still work as a microphone.

### H6OW5LSR

Purchased last July when we thought we were going to have more guest speakers.

- H6 is same mic technology as E6 but full headset.
- O is omnidirectional.
- W5 gain: more of a standard talking range. T may not get as loud as M but probably W6 is what I’d recommend.
- L means light beige. We want cocoa I think.
- SR is sennheiser.

### H6OW6CSR

If we want the headset version of what M used, I’d recommend H6OW6CSR - H6, Omni, W6 gain, Cocoa, Sennheiser.

## Additional thoughts

- I’m not convinced we want to stick with Sennheiser though? Would a Shure wireless system be worth a try?
- Should we try directional?
- There’s also a Countryman H7 - as far as I can tell, H7 is just hypercardioid, which means super directional?
