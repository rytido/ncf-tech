## Approach

## Current Issues

### High Priority

* Headset
* Move camera - try it out (or HDMI to Ethernet)
* Wireless signal issues - try moving receiver, otherwise an [antenna](https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/accessories/ua874)
* [Cable tester](https://www.amazon.com/Behringer-CT100-Professional-Instrument-Tester/dp/B000CCIVCA/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=mic+cable+tester&qid=1614649332&sr=8-2)
* Move house channels to the left on the board for better visual separation from Pastor's channel

## Medium Priority

* Clean sound room and rolltop
* House speaker
* Recalibrate DBX - low frequency issues during communion
* Better labels
* Try out choir mic closer to specific choir members to evaluate the value of purchasing additional

## Low Priority

* Consider giving up sound room for Sunday School?
* Move congregation mics?
* Better room mic?
* Voices are muddy
* Lid for drum shield? But then more tuning needed?
* Consider X32 Compact in the fall if budget allows
* Do we need to start putting mics away during week?

### Podcast

* Extract audio from youtube livestream
* Adjust loudness using ffmpeg (normalize might make this easier)
* Audio is more room sounding than ideal - too much reverb - however, livestream should have a lot of congregation so conflicting goals

## Misc

* Send out agenda in advance in the future
* Aaward for Dori
